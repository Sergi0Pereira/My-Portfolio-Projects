# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## ðŸ“– Background
# MAGIC You work in the analytics department of a multinational company, and the head of HR wants your help mapping out the company's employee network using message data. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC They plan to use the network map to understand interdepartmental dynamics better and explore how the company shares information. The ultimate goal of this project is to think of ways to improve collaboration throughout the company. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## ðŸ’¾ The data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The company has six months of information on inter-employee communication. For privacy reasons, only sender, receiver, and message length information are available [(source)](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/CollegeMsg.html). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Messages has information on the sender, receiver, and time.
# MAGIC - "sender" - represents the employee id of the employee sending the message.
# MAGIC - "receiver" - represents the employee id of the employee receiving the message.
# MAGIC - "timestamp" - the date of the message.
# MAGIC - "message_length" - the length in words of the message.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Employees has information on each employee;

# MAGIC - "department" - is the department within the company. 
# MAGIC - "location" - is the country where the employee lives.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Insights to accomplish:
# MAGIC

# MAGIC - Which employee has the most connections?
# MAGIC - Identify the most influential departments and employees.
# MAGIC - Using the network analysis, in which departments would you recommend the HR team focus to boost collaboration?
