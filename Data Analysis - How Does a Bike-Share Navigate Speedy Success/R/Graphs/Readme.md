This code uses several data visualization functions from the libraries tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, readr, gridExtra, and scales to create different plots based on the data stored in the "all_data_clean_fv" data frame.

The first plot created is a bar plot that shows the number of users based on their type. The function "geom_bar" from the ggplot2 library is used to create the plot, which maps the x-axis to the user type and the fill color to the user type as well. The scale_y_continuous function is used to set the number of breaks on the y-axis, and the labs function is used to set the label for the fill color. The x-axis label is set using xlab, and the y-axis label is set using ylab. Finally, the "theme" function is used to set the horizontal justification of the x and y-axis titles. The "ggsave" function is used to save the plot in a png file named "users_number.png".

The second plot created is a bar plot that shows the number of bikes based on their type. This plot is similar to the first plot, but it maps the x-axis to the bike type instead of the user type. The plot is saved in a png file named "total_bike_types.png".

The third plot created is a bar plot that shows the number of bikes of each type used by each user type. The "facet_wrap" function is used to create separate plots for each user type, and the "theme" function is used to rotate the x-axis text. The plot is saved in a png file named "bike_types_per_user.png".

The fourth plot created is a bar plot that shows the total trip length hours for each user type. The "geom_col" function is used to create the plot, which maps the x-axis to the user type, the y-axis to the trip length hours, and the fill color to the user type. The "scale_y_continuous" function is used to set the number of breaks on the y-axis, and the "labs" function is used to set the label for the fill color. The x-axis label is set using xlab, and the y-axis label is set using ylab. Finally, the "theme" function is used to set the horizontal justification of the x and y-axis titles. The plot is saved in a png file named "Users_trips_length_hours_by_user.png".

The fifth plot created is a bar plot that shows the average duration of trips for each user type. The "stat_summary" function is used to compute the mean trip length hours for each user type and create a bar plot. The plot is similar to the previous one, but the y-axis now shows the average trip length hours. The plot is saved in a png file named "avg_duration_trips_lenght_hours_per_user.png".

Finally, the code defines the order of the days of the week using the "dias_ordem" vector and converts the "day_of_week" column in the data frame to the correct order. The last plot created is a bar plot that shows the number of uses for each day of the week for each user type. The "facet_wrap" function is used again to create separate plots for each user type, and the "theme" function is used to rotate the x-axis text. The plot is saved in a png file named "days_of_the_week_use_per_user_type.png".
