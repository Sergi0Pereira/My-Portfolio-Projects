MySQL Documentation for the Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This MySQL code is creating a new database named "bike_riding_data" and then creating a table within that database called "all_data_clean". This table has several columns, including "ride_id", "rideable_type", "started_at", "ended_at", "start_station_name", "start_station_id", "end_station_name", "end_station_id", "start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng", and "member_casual".

The code then uses the LOAD DATA INFILE command to load data from a CSV file located at the specified path into a table called "tripdatacleaned_202209". It specifies that the fields in the CSV file are separated by commas, enclosed in double quotes, and terminated by a new line. It also ignores the first row of the CSV file, which is assumed to be a header row.

Next, the code inserts all the data from the "tripdatacleaned" tables for the months of February 2022 to January 2023 into the "all_data_clean" table using the UNION operator.

The code then alters the "all_data_clean" table to remove columns for latitude and longitude coordinates.

After that, it deletes any rows from the "all_data_clean" table that have missing or empty values for any of the required columns.

Then, two new columns are added to the "all_data_clean" table, "duration" and "duration2". "duration" is a calculated column that represents the duration of each ride in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. "duration2" is a calculated column that represents the total duration of all rides in hours.

Finally, the code updates the "duration2" column to calculate the total duration of all rides, and then deletes any rows from the "all_data_clean" table where the ride duration is less than or equal to zero.
