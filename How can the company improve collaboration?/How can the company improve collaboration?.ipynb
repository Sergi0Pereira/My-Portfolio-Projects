The ultimate goal of this project is to think of ways to improve collaboration throughout the company. \n\n## ðŸ’¾ The data\n\nThe company has six months of information on inter-employee communication. For privacy reasons, only sender, receiver, and message length information are available [(source)](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/CollegeMsg.html). \n\n#### Messages has information on the sender, receiver, and time.\n- \"sender\" - represents the employee id of the employee sending the message.\n- \"receiver\" - represents the employee id of the employee receiving the message.\n- \"timestamp\" - the date of the message.\n- \"message_length\" - the length in words of the message.\n\n#### Employees has information on each employee;\n- \"id\" - represents the employee id of the employee.\n- \"department\" - is the department within the company. \n- \"location\" - is the country where the employee lives.\n- \"age\" - is the age of the employee.\n\n#### Insights to accomplish:\n\n- Which departments are the most/least active?\n- Which employee has the most connections?\n- Identify the most influential departments and employees.\n- Using the network analysis, in which departments would you recommend the HR team focus to boost collaboration?\n\n_**Acknowledgments:** Pietro Panzarasa, Tore Opsahl, and Kathleen M.

It assigns the DataFrame to `dtEmployees` variable and displays the first 40 rows using `dtEmployees.show(n=40)`.\n\n3. **Load and Display Messages Data**: The code loads the messages data from a Delta Lake table located at \"dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/messages\" using the `loadDf()` function. It assigns the DataFrame to `dtMessages` variable and displays the first 40 rows using `dtMessages.show(40)`.\n\n4. **Total Messages Sent by Department**: The code joins the `dtEmployees` and `dtMessages` DataFrames on the \"id\" column of employees and \"sender\" column of messages. It then groups the data by the \"department\" column and calculates the count of messages sent by each department. The result is stored in the `dtTMS` DataFrame, which is sorted in descending order of \"Total Messages Sent\" column and displayed using `dtTMS.show()`.\n\n5. **Total Messages Received by Department**: Similar to the previous step, this code calculates the total number of messages received by each department. It joins the `dtEmployees` and `dtMessages` DataFrames on the \"id\" column of employees and \"receiver\" column of messages. The result is stored in the `dtTMR` DataFrame, which is sorted in descending order of \"Total Messages Received\" column and displayed using `dtTMR.show()`.\n\n6. **Total Messages (Activity) by Department**: The code combines the DataFrames `dtTMS` and `dtTMR` using the `unionAll` operation to get the total activity (sent and received messages) for each department. The result is stored in the `dtTM` DataFrame.\n\n7. **Most/Least Active Departments**: The code calculates the sum of \"Total Messages Sent\" and \"Total Messages Received\" for each department, and orders the result in descending order of \"Total Messages\". The result is stored in the `dtTMF` DataFrame, which is displayed using `dtTMF.show()`. The most active department is the one with the highest \"Total Messages\", and the least active department is the one with the lowest \"Total Messages\".\n\n8. **Employee with the Most Connections**: The code calculates the number of emails sent and received by each employee, along with the count of unique email addresses they interacted with. It joins the `dtEmployees` and `dtMessages` DataFrames based on the \"id\" column. The results are stored in the `dtTmsId` and `dtTmrId` DataFrames, which are displayed using `dtTmsId.show()` and `dtTmrId.show()` respectively.\n\n9. **Employee Connections**: The code joins the `dtTmsId` and `dtTmrId` DataFrames based on the \"id\" column to calculate the total connections (sum of unique emails sent and received). The result is stored in the `dtTmFId` DataFrame, which is displayed using `dtTmFId.show()`. The employee with the highest \"Connections\" value has the most connections.\n\n10. **Most Influential Departments and Employees**: The code calculates the sum of unique emails sent and received for each department and employee respectively. It then orders the departments and employees based on their \"Connections\" in descending order and selects the top 3 entries. The results are displayed using `dtMid.show()` and `dtMie.show()` respectively. The top 3 departments and employees with the highest \"Connections\" values are considered the most influential.\n\n11. **Less Influential Departments**: Similar to the previous step, this code calculates the sum of unique emails sent and received for each department, but orders the results in ascending order of \"Connections\". The top 3 departments with the lowest \"Connections\" values are considered less influential. The results are displayed using `dtMid.show()`.\n\n12. **Recommendations for HR Team**: The code suggests that the HR team should focus on boosting collaboration in the Engineering, Marketing, and IT departments. These departments have been identified as less influential based on the analysis."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.sql.functions import *\nfrom pyspark.sql import
